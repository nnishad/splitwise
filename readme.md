# OpenSource Splitwise Clone

### A Free and Open-Source Alternative to Splitwise

Splitwise has become a popular app for managing shared expenses, but many of its essential features are now locked behind a paywall. Our goal is to create a **completely free and open-source alternative** that offers the same (or even more) functionality as Splitwise, without any restrictions.

### Features:
- **Individual and Group Expenses**: Add expenses for yourself or with friends and track them easily.
- **Flexible Splitting Options**: Split bills equally, unequally, by percentage, or custom shares.
- **Groups**: Organize shared expenses for group activities such as trips or house expenses.
- **Real-time Balance Tracking**: See who owes what in real time.
- **User-friendly**: Simple UI for managing expenses without hassle.

### Tech Stack:
- **Backend**: TypeScript with PostgreSQL and TypeORM

### Current Status:
The backend development is in progress, and we are now looking for contributors to help with **frontend development and integration**.

### Looking for Contributors:
We are specifically looking for developers interested in:
- **Frontend Development**: Build the user interface using modern frameworks and technologies.
- **Integration**: Help connect the frontend with our backend services.

If you are passionate about building a free and open-source alternative to Splitwise, weâ€™d love for you to join us!
